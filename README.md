docker --version
docker-compose --version
```
2. Clone this repository (make sure that you have installed the git):
``` Bash
git clone https://github.com/Klipar/speech_to_text_convertor.git
cd speech_to_text_convertor
```
3. Build a Docker image
This command builds the container with the project (using a `Dockerfile`).
``` Bash
docker-compose build
```
4. If the installation went smoothly, then congratulations, now you can start using it!


## Usage/Examples

1. Launch the container and immediately enter the terminal to work with the program:
``` Bash
docker-compose run --rm speech-to-text bash
```
2. To use, simply enter the following command to start the script execution:
``` Bash
python main.py
```
You can also specify the name of the file to be transcribed right at startup as follows:
``` Bash
python main.py Path/to/your/audio.file
```
3. Select the recognition language.
4. Specify the path to the audio file (if you haven't already done so when you start the program).
5. You can format it for easier viewing or skip this step.
